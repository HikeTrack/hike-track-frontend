          <p className={styles.history}>
            Our team started as a group of friends united by a shared love of 
            nature and adventure. Our first hike together showed us that hiking is 
            more than a hobbyâ€”it's a passion that connects people. 
          </p>

          <p className={styles.history}>
            We began organizing hikes for friends and acquaintances, and soon decided to create a project 
            to help others join our journeys. This led to the creation of our website, 
            where we share trails, tips, and bring together like-minded people. 
            Our goal is to make hiking accessible to everyone who seeks new horizons and adventures.

        <h3 className={styles.titleSmall}>Idea and Development of the Website</h3>

        <p className={styles.history}>
          Idea: Our website was born from a shared love of hiking and a 
          desire to share this passion with others. Observing how our hikes 
          bring people together and create unforgettable moments, we decided 
          to create a platform that helps others discover the joys of outdoor 
          adventures.
